Zimbabwean Agriculture Syllabus – Local Context Knowledge Base

1. Indigenous Trees:
- Hardwood Trees: Mukwa (Pterocarpus angolensis), Pod Mahogany (Afzelia quanzensis), Zimbabwean Teak (Baikiaea plurijuga), Acacia spp.
- Softwood Trees: Pine (Pinus spp.), Cypress (Cupressus spp.), Eucalyptus (Note: Not indigenous but widely naturalized)

2. Agroforestry:
- Agroforestry systems in Zimbabwe often include combinations of maize intercropped with trees like Leucaena, Sesbania, or Faidherbia albida.
- Trees provide shade, fuelwood, fodder, and help in nitrogen fixation.
- Mukwa and Acacia are used in boundary planting and windbreaks.

3. Soil and Water Conservation:
- Indigenous techniques include contour plowing, stone bunds, infiltration pits.
- Vetiver grass and trees like Acacia are used for erosion control.
- Mulching with crop residues is common in low rainfall areas like Matabeleland South.

4. Indigenous Knowledge in Pest and Disease Control:
- Use of ashes, chilli, neem extracts to deter pests.
- Intercropping with repellent crops (e.g. garlic, marigold).
- Ashes used to preserve harvested grains in rural granaries.

5. Indigenous Livestock Breeds:
- Cattle: Mashona, Tuli, Nkone – resistant to heat and local diseases.
- Goats: Small East African goat – well adapted to drought-prone areas.
- Poultry: Road runner chickens (free range) – popular in communal areas.

6. Climate Resilient Crops:
- Sorghum, Pearl Millet, Cowpeas, Groundnuts, Bambara nuts.
- Traditional grains are drought tolerant and suited to semi-arid regions.
- Conservation agriculture (zero tillage) promoted in drought-affected provinces.

7. Seed Preservation:
- Traditional seed banks use clay pots, calabashes, and ash layering.
- Seeds are stored in dark, cool huts away from pests.
- Seed exchange is common in communal farming communities.

8. Cultural Practices in Agriculture:
- Certain trees are spiritually significant and are preserved (e.g. Mubvamaropa).
- Rainmaking ceremonies by traditional leaders precede planting season.
- Lunar planting calendars followed in some rural areas.

9. Agricultural Calendar:
- Farming is closely tied to the Zimbabwean rain season (Nov–March).
- April to June is the post-harvest season.
- August–October is land preparation and conservation period.

10. Agricultural Tools:
- Traditional hoes (badza), ox-drawn ploughs, hand-harvest sickles.
- Use of donkey carts in dry regions where cattle numbers are low.

11. Value Addition:
- Drying vegetables like pumpkin leaves (muboora), cowpea leaves (munyemba).
- Peanut butter production using traditional pestles and mortar.
- Home-scale oil pressing from sunflower or groundnuts in some wards.

12. Emerging Issues:
- Effects of climate change: shifting rain patterns, increased droughts, pest outbreaks.
- Migration of youth away from agriculture.
- Importance of ICT tools and solar-powered irrigation in smallholder farming.

13. Urban and Peri-Urban Farming:
- Chicken projects, sack gardening, rabbitry in urban high-density suburbs.
- Key for food security especially during economic downturns.

14. Government and NGO Programmes:
- Pfumvudza/Intwasa program promoting conservation agriculture.
- Agricultural extension services and farmer field schools.
- Livelihood support from NGOs like World Vision, AGRITEX, and FAO Zimbabwe.

15. Local Food Systems:
- Open-air markets (e.g. Mbare Musika) connect rural producers with urban consumers.
- Preservation methods include sun drying, smoking, fermenting (e.g. maheu, dried meat “chimukuyu”).

16. Career Paths in Agriculture:
- Crop science, animal husbandry, soil science, veterinary science, agri-business.
- Hands-on training through agricultural colleges like Gwebi and Chibero.

This knowledge base supports localized, syllabus-aligned teaching for RAG models and education apps in Zimbabwe.
